== Overview

A RESTful API for money transfers between accounts.

== HTTP Verbs and Status Codes

Ths API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions.
The `GET` and `POST` HTTP verbs are used to retrieve and create a resource respectively.
The HTTP status codes currently in use are:

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| Standard response for successful HTTP requests. Used for GET requests.

| `201 Created`
| The POST request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created.

| `400 Bad Request`
| The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error
(e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).

The response body usually contains a JSON field "message" with more information about the error.
| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future.
Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.

| `409 Conflict`
| The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource.

Particularly on this API, this error occurs when there aren't enough funds in the source account for
the transfer.
